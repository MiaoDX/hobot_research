## NOTES

It seems that the dataset will hardly be OpenSourced, see[caffemodel for VPGNet #9](https://github.com/SeokjuLee/VPGNet/issues/9) and [DataSet #2](https://github.com/SeokjuLee/VPGNet/issues/2):

> Regarding the dataset, please check Readme file ("Dataset contact" section) for the dataset questions. It turns out that Samsung wants to have an exclusive control who gets the dataset. Good luck!
> The dataset will be available, but currently is being reviewed by Samsung company. They are undergoing a merger and restructuring, which is delaying the work.

And the model the author provided is somewhat strange, with name `name: "VPGNet-noVP"`, yes, **noVP** ...
